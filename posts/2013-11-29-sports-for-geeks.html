<p>Over the last few months, I have been acquiring various tidbits of knowledge to do with sports. This has been essential since my girlfriend likes football.</p>
<p>Here is a brief summary of what I’ve learned:</p>
<h3 id="dannys-neanderthal-level-guide-to-sports">Danny’s Neanderthal-Level Guide to Sports</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Football players don’t wear “tights”</li>
<li>It’s never OK to say “This is pointless”</li>
<li>Touchdowns are good</li>
<li>Flags are bad</li>
<li>Unless it’s against the other team</li>
<li>The ref is dumb. Always</li>
<li>Penalties are bad</li>
<li>Unless it’s against the other team</li>
<li>The other team is barely human</li>
<li>It is acceptable to dance upon completing a “touch-down”</li>
<li>Field goals are good</li>
<li>Smiling is bad</li>
<li>Upon fumbling, a player is dead to us</li>
<li>It is acceptable to shoot the quarter back following an interception</li>
<li>Make-up for fans is OK if it’s the teams colors</li>
<li>Beer hats are ingenious precisely within a stadium</li>
<li>Shirts are always optional in a stadium. Even in November. Or when you’re overweight.</li>
<li>the-team-we-don’t-like (TTWDL) will never win. Ever.</li>
<li>TTWDL is synonymous with devil.</li>
<li>People who support TTWDL are the devil’s children</li>
<li>the-team-we-like (TTWL) are meant to win. Any other outcome is not possible</li>
<li>The quarter-back is always hot</li>
<li>An injury on the TTWL is unspeakably horrible</li>
<li>If you yell at the TV, they can hear you</li>
<li>Some teams just need to be put out of their misery early in the season</li>
<li>It is never OK to say “it’s just a game”</li>
<li>Football players are not just big kids who never grew up</li>
<li>If someone is “first pick” then they are good and we want then on our team</li>
<li>“Our team” is an appropriate saying for a team that we like even though we are in no way associated with that team</li>
<li>Fantasy football isn’t silly or at all like Dungeons and Dragons and other pretend games</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all I got so far.</p>
