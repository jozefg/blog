title: Colleges and My Not-So-Distant Future
----

This is a short but excited post.

I'm a senior in high school and that means colleges. This weekend has been
a rather interesting one, I've been accepted to two schools I've always
dreamed about, MIT and CMU.

I was absolutely shocked. I've been wanting the chance to go to a school
like either of them since I was 8. These last 9 or so months have seen me wobbling
back and forth between hopelessness, confidence, and excitement over the idea of attending.
The fact that both want me and that I'm actually getting to go is humbling, terrifying,
and making me a little teary-eyed all at the same time.

I've decided I'll be attending Carnegie Mellon University next fall. It
wasn't an easy choice by any stretch; blood, sweat and tears were shed over
it, but I'm happy with my decision.

I'd like to take a moment to extend my sincerest thanks to any and everyone
who has helped me get through what's proving to be a long 4 years. It means
the world to me.

In particular, I'll never be able to thank those who have
given me the chance to work at labs at the U of M and MIT enough. They've taken
me a few steps closer to my dreams and I know that without them I'd have
never been accepted.

Now of course, I have to make it 4 years at CMU :)
