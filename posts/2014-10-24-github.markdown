title: Update on Old Projects
tags: haskell, personal

All though most people I talk to know me for my blog, I do
occasionally actually write software instead of just talking about it
:)

Sadly, as a mercurial user most of my stuff has languished with on
bitbucket. I've had a few people tell me that this is annoying for
various reasons. Yesterday, I finally got around to fixing that!

As of yesterday, all of my interesting projects are mirrored on
[github][my-github]. I'm still using mercurial but thanks to the
lovely git-hg tool this is not an issue. You can fork, pull-request,
or generally peek and poke as you please. From my end all of these
actions look like nice mercurial changesets so I can continue to live
under my rock where I don't need to understand Git.

As a quick list of what haskell code is up there now

 - [c-dsl][c-dsl]
 - [c_of_scheme][c_of_scheme]
 - [ds-kanren][ds-kanren]
 - [generic-church][generic-church]
 - [hasquito][hasquito]
 - [hlf][hlf]
 - [monad-gen][monad-gen]
 - [reified-records][reified-records]
 - [this blog][that-blog]

Which I think includes every project I've blogged about here as well
as a few others. Sorry it took so long!
