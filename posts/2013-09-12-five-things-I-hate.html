<p>I was on programmers.stackexchange today and I say an interesting question, <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/159754/why-the-question-give-five-things-you-hate-about-c-is-so-difficult-to-answer">Why the question “give five things you hate about C#” is so difficult to answer during an interview?</a>. It got me thinking, can I name 5 things I hate about my Haskell, my favorite language?</p>
<p>Well the short answer is, Yes and here they are</p>
<h3 id="prelude">1. Prelude</h3>
<p>I know exactly <em>why</em> <code>map</code>, <code>foldl</code>, and friends are monomorphic, it doesn’t stop me from muttering about having to import <code>Data.Foldable</code> and hide a bunch of stuff.</p>
<h3 id="modules">2. Modules</h3>
<p>Haskell’s modules are in essence the barest minimum needed to be a module system. I wish we had first class modules, ML-style functors, etc etc</p>
<h3 id="records">3. Records</h3>
<p>This has been talked to death… I don’t like records, they’re pretty hacky. Happily <code>lens</code> pretty much works wherever I’d normally use records. This may improve after the GSoC project for generic records functions gets merged.</p>
<h3 id="monomorphism">4. Monomorphism</h3>
<p>I don’t mind the monomorphism restriction, but I do wish that the errors it generates on GHC referenced the monomorphic variable rather than saying “can’t unify”Foo&quot; with “Bar”“. I’m well aware that a <code>Foo</code> isn’t a <code>Bar</code>, but seeing why some type var magically became <code>Foo</code> would be helpful.</p>
<p>Also, it’d be nice if when mentioned, monomorphic variables were different syntactically than normal onces, perhaps prefixed with ! or _.</p>
<h3 id="fail">5. <code>fail</code></h3>
<p>I really wish that <code>fail</code> wasn’t part of the <code>monad</code> specification. Everywhere else in Haskell, if you don’t provide the appropriate case to a pattern match, you get a runtime failure, fine.</p>
<p>But in a <code>do</code> block, you might just end up with <code>fail</code>. Which is <em>probably</em> a runtime exception, but might also be a parser failure or <code>Nothing</code> or <code>Left</code> or something else just to name a few. Ick.</p>
<p>I’d much prefer it if we just had runtime failures and then used <code>mzero</code> when we want failure. That’s what it’s for.</p>
