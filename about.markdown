Hello,

My name is Danny Gratzer, I am an incoming freshman at Carnegie Mellon
University. I can be found haunting a coffee shop with a laptop and a
cup of black coffee.

## CS Stuff
I like functional type theory and compilers. I also enjoy a good bit of
math and logic. I like writing Haskell, Coq or Agda.

## Juggling
I've been for almost 10 years now. I've competed internationally a few
times and have a few bits of metal to prove it. I mostly now hit
myself upside the head with 5 or 6 clubs nowadays.

## Projects
I have a few projects, listed below in no particular order

  - [c_of_scheme](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/c_of_scheme)

    A tiny compiler from Scheme to C, implementing a few cool things.

  - [generic-church](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/generic-church)

    Automatic isomorphisms for Church representations (on Hackage)

  - [reified-records](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/reified-records)

    Generic manipulations of records, including reification to a `Map`. (on Hackage)

  - [c-dsl](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/c-dsl)

    Build up C ASTs conveniently in Haskell (on Hackage)

  - [melody](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/melody)

    A stack based, higher order, functional language. Poorly documented, but
    fun to monkey with.

And quite a few other, less polished, projects on my [bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg) account.

## Find Me
I'm active on a few sites, usually under the handle jozefg.
You can find me on twitter as [jozefg28](https://twitter.com/jozefg28).
