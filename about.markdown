Hello,

My name is Danny Gratzer, I am a high school student in the US.

## Programming
I like functional programming. Specifically, I write lots of compilers
and type checkers in Haskell and Lisp (Common Lisp, Scheme). 

I also like formal verification and worked with PLV at CSAIL developing
verified compilers.

## Juggling
I've been juggling since 3rd grade. Nowadays I am a member of the
Ultimate Club and a volunteer at Jugheads Youth Juggling Company.

## Find Me
I'm active on a few sites, usually under the handle jozefg.
