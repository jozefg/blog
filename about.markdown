Hello,

My name is Danny Gratzer, I am a high school student in the US.

## Programming
I like functional programming and types. Specifically, I write lots of compilers
and type checkers in Haskell and Agda. Formal methods is also a pretty nifty field
so I spend nontrivial amounts of time arguing with Coq's typechecker.

I can't quite seem to shake my love of lisps so I can always enjoy writing
something in Scheme/Racket or Common Lisp.

## Juggling
I've been juggling since 3rd grade. Nowadays I am a member of the
Ultimate Club and a volunteer at Jugheads Youth Juggling Company.

## Projects
I have a few projects, listed below in no particular order

  - [c_of_scheme](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/c_of_scheme)

    A tiny compiler from Scheme to C

  - [generic-church](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/generic-church)

    Automatic isomorphisms for Church representations (on Hackage)

  - [reified-records](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/reified-records)

    Generic manipulations of records, including reification to a `Map`. (on Hackage)

  - [c-dsl](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/c-dsl)

    Build up C ASTs conveniently in Haskell (on Hackage)

  - [melody](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg/melody)

    A stack based, higher order, functional language. Poorly documented, but
    this should be improved Real Soon Now.

And quite a few other, less polished, projects on my [bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg) account.

## Find Me
I'm active on a few sites, usually under the handle jozefg.
