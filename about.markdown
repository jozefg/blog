Hello,

My name is Danny Gratzer, I am a high school student in the US.

## Programming
I like functional programming and types. Specifically, I write lots of compilers
and type checkers in Haskell and Agda. Formal methods is also a pretty nifty field
so I spend nontrivial amounts of time arguing with Coq's typechecker.

I can't quite seem to shake my love of lisps so I can always enjoy writing
something in Scheme/Racket or Common Lisp.

## Juggling
I've been juggling since 3rd grade. Nowadays I am a member of the
Ultimate Club and a volunteer at Jugheads Youth Juggling Company.

## Find Me
I'm active on a few sites, usually under the handle jozefg.
You can find me on twitter as [@jozefg28](https://twitter.com/jozefg28).
