Hello,

My name is Danny Gratzer, I am a freshman at Carnegie Mellon
University. I can be found haunting a coffee shop with a laptop and a
cup of black coffee.

## CS Stuff
I like functional type theory and compilers. I also enjoy a good bit of
math, mostly abstract algebra or logic. I like writing Haskell, SML, Coq or Agda.

## Projects
I have a few projects most of which are licensed permissively under
the MIT license. They can all be found on my
[bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org/jozefg) account. The more
interesting ones have also found a home on
[github](http://www.github.com/jozefg).

If you feel the urge to contribute to any of these, please email :)

## Find Me
I'm active on a few sites, usually under the handle jozefg.
You can find me on twitter as [jozefg28](https://twitter.com/jozefg28).
